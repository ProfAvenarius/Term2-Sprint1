<!-- Description: SPRINT1 SD12 a webpage design to facilitate sales of fish direct to consumer, welcome to the 
                  the landing page for First Catch. Where this began is very different than the end result, the 
                  original design began as a 'parallax' effect,but it did not produce the effect desired, and after
                  much play, the final design combined css animation with js effects. There is some unnecessary  
                  and duplicative code, due to this process.
                  All coding was done on VS CODE using Live Server and tested in Chrome
